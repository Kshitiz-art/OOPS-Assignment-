        "Focus: On the what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",

        "Encapsulation:\n",
        "Purpose: To bundle data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, and restrict access to some components.\n",
        "\n",
        "Focus: On protecting the internal state of an object and ensuring that it can only be changed through well-defined methods.\n",

        "Ans ✅ 1. Code Reusability (Inheritance)\n",
        "\n",
        "OOP allows you to reuse existing code by inheriting properties and methods from parent classes.\n",
        "Example: A Vehicle class can be inherited by Car and Bike classes, reducing duplicate code.\n",
        "✅ 2. Encapsulation (Data Hiding & Security)\n",
        "\n",
        "Sensitive data can be protected by making attributes private using __.\n",
        "Example: A BankAccount class can hide the balance and only allow controlled access through methods.\n",
        "✅ 3. Polymorphism (Flexibility & Extensibility)\n",
        "\n",
        "A single interface can be used for different types of objects, making the code more flexible.\n",
        "Example: A draw() method in a Shape class can be used for both Circle and Rectangle.\n",
        "✅ 4. Abstraction (Simplifies Complex Systems)\n",
        "\n",
        "Hides complex details and exposes only necessary functionality.\n",
        "Example: A Car class can have a drive() method without exposing engine details.\n",
        "✅ 5. Scalability & Maintainability\n",
        "\n",
        "Since code is modular, it’s easier to update, scale, and maintain over time.\n",
        "Large projects become more manageable due to clear class structures.\n",
        "✅ 6. Modularity (Dividing Code into Small Parts)\n",
        "\n",
        "Classes act as independent modules, making debugging and testing easier.\n",
        "Example: Different teams can work on different modules like User, Order, and Payment.\n",
